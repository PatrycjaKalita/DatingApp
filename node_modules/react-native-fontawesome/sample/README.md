# Sample Project

This is a sample project to show how to use the `react-native-fontawesome` package.
The version of React Native used in this project is 0.59.9.
The version of Font Awesome used in this project is 5.9.0 Free.

## Build and run

Just run the commands:

`npm install`
`react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` 

## Warning!

I didn't have any IPhone/MAC in hands to test at the moment, so I don't know if the IOS version is working properly.
